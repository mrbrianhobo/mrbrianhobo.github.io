          My first encounter with Bitcoin was in the summer of my sophomore year in high school (2014). I was bored out of my mind. So what does a bored high schooler do to have fun? Well, this one over here (aka me) watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ">cat videos</a> on Youtube and played a MMORPG called <a href="http://maplestory.nexon.net/">Maplestory</a>. I wasn't exactly the most ethical player at the time, so I would occasionally browse secondary markets on forums and find players selling their in-game items for real money (i.e. Paypal, MoneyPak, Western Union). But sometimes, I would find that people were taking payments in something called "BTC." And that got my attention. I thought to myself, "What is this BTC thing that I'm seeing?" So, I googled it and discovered the world of Bitcoin. <br> <br>

          Among the top search results, I saw the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141021073049/https://www.coinbase.com/">"Coinbase"</a>. Little did I know that, this would be the company that I'd be applying to 4 years later. Even despite knowing about Coinbase, there was no way that my parents would let me buy this "cryptocurrency" to play around with. After all, none of us even knew what cryptocurrencies were. So instead of asking for my parents permission, I wanted to find a way to get Bitcoin myself. <br> <br>

          Mining was completely out of the question. I didn't have the money to buy Bitcoin much less buy hardware to mine Bitcoin. So like a complete noob, I resorted to Bitcoin faucets. These paid out Bitcoin in tiny, tiny increments (e.g. 100 satoshi). But it was enough to make me feel happy. I also discovered a way to multiply my earnings without any real effort--gambling. I played this RNG dice game called <a href="https://primedice.com/">Primedice</a> and hoped that I could turn my 100 satoshi into a fortune. But I slowly realized that gambling isn't a very reliable method to earn money. So all my hard earned Bitcoin from faucets, gradually disappeared. My interest in Bitcoin was brief, and I forgot about it when school started up again. <br>

        <div class="entry">
          Fast forward 2 years to 2016 and I'm an incoming freshman at UC Berkeley. As a freshman, I didn't really know what my interests were. I was just  very open to exploring and learning new things! Luckily, there were these courses on campus called <a href="https://decal.berkeley.edu/about/decal-program">DeCals</a>. These were student taught courses offered to let other students explore different interests from baking to speaking Cantonese! Surprisingly enough, there was a student group offering a <a href="https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/decal/fa16/">DeCal on cryptocurrencies</a>. Being the curious freshman I was, I decided to sit in and find out more! <br> <br>

          I learned how different cryptocurrencies worked and a bunch of other really interesting topics. But what's important was that this course completely opened my eyes to the world of blockchain! And ever since taking that DeCal, my college course has taken a wild turn for the better! <br> <br>

          Currently, I'm a third-year undergrad at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) and Economics. On campus, I'm heavily involved with Blockchain at Berkeley and its education side, helping lead a course on <a href="https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/decal/">Blockchain Fundamentals</a> which covers a variety of topics in the cryptocurrency and the wider blockchain space (go check it out!). Some of the things I'm particularly interested in (pertaining to blockchains) include cybersecurity (particularly smart contract security), cryptoeconomics & protocol design, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs aka CryptoKitties). <br> <br>

          I’ve also had my fair share of blockchain experience from developing on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the first projects that I
          helped build was <a href="https://github.com/mrbrianhobo/ProvenanceSupplyChain">Provenance</a>. This
          was a supply chain proof-of-concept that showed how we could use the blockchain to help track and trace the origins of
          pharmaceuticals. Another DApp I worked on recently was a hackathon project called <a href="https://github.com/mrbrianhobo/bountyful">Bountyful</a>. This was a Chrome extension we designed to attach "bounties" to
          StackOverflow forum questions so users would get rewarded for answering correctly (which ended up winning the <a href="https://medium.com/gitcoin/gitcoin-ethdenver-wrap-up-cc52d9874b38">"Best
          Bounty Network" prize</a> at ETHDenver)! <br> <br>

          This past summer, I was interning at <a href="https://consensys.net/">ConsenSys</a> with the <a href="https://bounties.network/">Bounties Network</a> team, improving the way we collaborate and creating a standard for outsourcing tasks online. I'm also helping out as an Expert-in-Residence for Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/blockchain-developer-nanodegree--nd1309">Blockchain Developer Nanodegree</a> program, answering questions and offering students guidance about working in the blockchain space! <br>

        <header class="title">Why Coinbase?</header>
        <div class="entry">
          So why do I want to work at Coinbase? <br> <br>

          I’m a big supporter of blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption and I think Coinbase is doing a really great job at that. I think that having easily accessible services to buy and sell cryptocurrencies is the largest factor to achieve the widespread adoption that crypto is looking for. And as someone who has tried to purchase cryptocurrencies in the past, I really think that Coinbase is the best and easiest platform to do just that. Coinbase is like the "gateway drug" to the crypto and blockchain ecosystem, and I’d like to be a part of the team that helps bring cryptocurrencies to the masses. <br> <br>

          And watching one of the largest players in the blockchain space, I really appreciate that Coinbase is placing a huge focus on design and creating products that are necessary to build up the user base that crypto really needs. There are still a bunch of problems that the blockchain system we have today have to get right (privacy, scalability, etc.), but watching Coinbase and seeing where you guys stand, I realized that I really want to be there and work on the challenges that you guys are facing everyday. After all, Coinbase is one the first stations that people will eventually have to stop at before they continue down the crazy crypto train ride. <br> <br>

          I want to use what I've learned in the blockchain space and help ideate and work on solutions for this young and still experimental technology. Also I'd love to use my experience from teaching a student course on blockchain and contribute to Coinbase's education portal! Given that I'm still a student and haven't had that much experience with software development, I also want to use this time to also learn from the best engineers out there and #buidl!
